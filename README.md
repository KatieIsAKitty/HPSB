# HPSB

Hi!
If you are here, you most likely wanted to see easy to browse list of collections and recipes for Hypixel's Skyblock.  
(Not that the one on server is hard to navigate, i just find it way slower due to amounts of nesting)

**Repository is in Work-in-Progress state, so many features are yet to be added.**

## Current Status

In [collections](./Collections.md/#collections), so far all are listed, but only those i have access to are filled. At the moment none is linked further (except cobblestone minion for testing purposes), that's not the biggest priority on the to do list.  
[Recipes](./Recipes.md/#recipes) are not actually filled in any way. There's only one minion with recipes listed. Reason for that is because i don't have idea how to make this look like. Most likely links from [collections](./Collections.md/#collections) will *not* link directly to recipes, but to some form of explanation page, which then will have link to respective recipes.

Repository was started, and is so far actual to version **0.7**. Partially written in the moment of [Skyblock issues](https://hypixel.net/threads/skyblock-issues-august.2258490/).  
  
Please keep in mind that this repository is maintaned by only one person. If you notice any outdated values or lists, items flagged as Coming Soon (`(CS)`) that were released, new collections or even slightest typos, please make an issue for them, or if you are able to, create a pull request. All help is appreciated :)

Disclaimer: this repository and me myself are not in any way affiliated with Hypixel. Rank i have on server is unrelated in any way with it. This is just a list mantained in free time.
You can find me on Hypixel under name `tipakA`
