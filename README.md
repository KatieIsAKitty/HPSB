# HPSB

Hi!
If you are here, you most likely wanted to see easy to browse list of collections and recipes for Hypixel's Skyblock.  
(Not that the one on server is hard to navigate, i just find it way slower due to amounts of nesting)

Please keep in mind that this repository is maintaned by only one person. If you want to help, you can make an issue, or even make a PR. All help is appreciated :)

## Current Status

In [collections](./Collections.md/#collections), so far all are listed, but only those i have access to are filled. At the moment none is linked further (except cobblestone minion for testing purposes), that's not the biggest priority on the to do list.  
[Recipes](./Recipes.md/#recipes) are not actually filled in any way. There's only one minion with recipes listed. Reason for that is because i don't have idea how to make this look like. Most likely links from [collections](./Collections.md/#collections) will *not* link directly to recipes, but to some form of explanation page, which then will have link to respective recipes.

Repository was started, and is so far actual to version **0.7**. Partially written in the moment of [Skyblock issues](https://hypixel.net/threads/skyblock-issues-august.2258490/).
